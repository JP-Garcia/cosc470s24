Here is Meta-Llama-3-8B running locally on my nvidia GPU, using the Transformers loader.

For Screenshot 1, I don't know why it hallucinated the whole thing about nanites. 
I got better and faster results with different loaders, but this was how it worked out with the default one.

For Screenshot 2, I used the instruction provided by the Youtube tutorial, which worked out better.
